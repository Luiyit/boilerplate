# wp-timber-boilerplate

2. [Gulp sass simple boilerplate](https://github.com/Fedorrychkov/gulp-sass-simple-boilerplate)

# How to use
1. Download the zip for this theme (or clone it) and move it to wp-content/themes in your WordPress installation.
2. Install [Timber plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/)
3. Rename the folder to something that makes sense for your website (generally no spaces and all lowercase). You could keep the name wp-timber-boilerplate but the point of a starter theme is to make it your own!
